Geocaching application

# Description
Full-stack Java application using microservice architecture deployed to a kubernetes cluster.

# My Role
I worked on many aspects of this program. I wrote most of the backend for the "GeoCache" microservice. I worked on integrating and setting up a Jenkins server and the jobs that it would execute. I set up the kubernetes cluster environment where the application was deployed.
